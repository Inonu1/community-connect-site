  <h1>Flag Retirement Community Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Fremont neighborhood</p>

  <p>Volunteers went door-to-door in the neighborhood to collect flags that needed to be retired. Each retired flag was disposed of in a respectful ceremony on the 4th of July. New flags were purchased from Costco to replace the collected ones and sold at the same price for record-keeping. Additional support was provided by installing flags for residents where needed.</p>

  <p>The project combined civic service with community engagement, leaving residents with both a sense of tradition and renewed flags for their homes.</p>
